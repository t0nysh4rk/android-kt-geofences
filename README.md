A geofence is a virtual perimeter defined by GPS or RFID around a real world area.
Geofences can be created with a radius around a point location. 

Pre-requisites
--------------
- The latest version of Android Studio.
- A minimum of SDK API 29 on your device or emulator. (This should still work on lower API levels but may look different)


Getting Started
---------------
1. Download and run the app.
2. If you are running API 29 or higher, grant the "Always allow" permission; otherwise, grant "Allow" for location permissions.

Note: If you are running this app on an emulator, you will need to use another app to pull location data from.
This is because geofencing relies on device sensors to detect the location of the device, which the emulator cannot access.
